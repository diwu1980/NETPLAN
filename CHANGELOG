Version 1.39
 - Fixed bugs with sustainability index

Version 1.38
 - solver.cpp: Fixed major bug on Benders decomposition

Version 1.37
 - IMPORTANT: Updated code to run with CPlex 12.2, see the following for available servers: http://it.eng.iastate.edu/remote
 - Storage doesn't interfere with Benders decomposition
 - global.cpp: Timer added to find execution times
 - write.cpp: Fixed function that writes output
 - Fixed more bugs

Version 1.36
 - read.cpp: Allow monthly data input without repeating per year (needs testing).
 - arc.cpp: New property "InvertEff" allows changing efficiency in energy balance constraints, useful for generators (needs testing).
 - Fixed various bugs related to reading files, steps, comments, solver...

Version 1.35
 - Fixed some bugs in the solver module
 - Added solution of different events
 - Use sustainability metrics as NSGA-II objectives
 - Started: Calculation of resiliency metrics based on events

Version 1.34
 - read.cpp: Added capability of adding sustainability metrics and objectives
 - preprocess.cpp, arc.cpp, solve.cpp: Compatible with multiple sustainability metrics
 - Implement national constraints for sustanaibility metrics
 - Introduced reading capacity events for resiliency calculations
 - postnsga.cpp: First attempt at reporting NSGA-II solution (objectives + investments by type and location). Still experimental.

Version 1.33
 - global.cpp: CleanLine() updated to allow comments in input files, using "%" character (not tested thoroughly)
 - solver.cpp, solver.h: Implementation completed for solving and solution reporting with and without Benders
 - preprocess.cpp, postprocess.cpp, index.cpp: Updated to fully integrate Benders decomposition (including reporting)
 - Created metrics.cpp, metrics.h
 - Full integration of Benders decomposition in NSGA-II
 - NSGA-II parameters can be changed with parameters.csv
